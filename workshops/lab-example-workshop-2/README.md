# Workshop

This workshop uses imgpkg to download the set of VS Code extensions from GitHub container
registry, bypassing open-vsx.org. Installation is much quicker, but it is still pulling
down 150MB+ for each workshop session directly from GitHub. Downloading the extensions
can therefore still take up to 15 seconds.
